Willard Christopher "Will" Smith, Jr. (born September 25, 1968)[2] is an American actor, producer, and rapper.
He has enjoyed success in television, film and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him the most powerful actor in
Hollywood.[3] Smith has been nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four
Grammy Awards.
In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity
increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for
nearly six years (1990-1996) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. In the
mid-1990s, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the
only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, and ten consecutive
films gross over $150 million internationally and the only one to have eight consecutive films in which he starred
open at #1 spot in the domestic box office tally.[4]

Sixteen of the twenty fiction films he has acted in have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million,
and four took in over $500 million in global box office receipts. As of 2012, his films have grossed $6.36 billion in
global box office.[5] He received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.

Family and early life
Smith was born and raised in West Philadelphia, and he has also lived in Germantown in Northwest Philadelphia.
His mother, Caroline , was a school administrator who worked for the Philadelphia school board, and his
father, Willard Christopher Smith, Sr., was a refrigeration engineer.[6][7] He was raised Baptist.[8] His parents
separated when he was thirteen,[] but did not actually divorce until around 2000.[]

It is untrue, though widely reported, that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT); he never applied to the school,[9] although he was admitted to a "pre-engineering program"
there.[] According to Smith, "My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was
the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have
gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."[10]

Recording and acting career

Smith at the Emmy Awards in 1993

Early work

Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh
Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as
turntablist and producer,[11] as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence
Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing
humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably "Parents Just Don't
Understand" and "Summertime".[11] They gained critical acclaim and
won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).[11]

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his
income taxes.[11] The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a
$2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income.[12] Smith was nearly
bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air, around him.[11]

The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie
star in the world," studying box office successes' common characteristics.[]

Feature films
Smith's first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in
which he starred opposite of Martin Lawrence.
In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. The film was a massive
blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box
office draw.[13] He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit
Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.[11]

He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of 
Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's 
performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved,[14] although in interviews subsequent 
to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he "made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been

better."[15]

Smith in May 2012

In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for
attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.[16]

He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It
Takes a Thief.[17]

On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on
Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the
world renowned theater in front of many fans.[18] Later that month, Smith
starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite
marginally positive reviews,[19] its opening was the largest ever for a film
released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he
considers the film to be "aggressively unique".[20] A reviewer said that the
film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one
box office draw in Hollywood."[21] On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported
that Smith has been selected as one of  top ten most fascinating
people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.[22]

Smith was reported in 2008 to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he will star as Taharqa.[23]

US President Barack Obama has stated that if a film were to ever be made about his life, he would have Smith play
his part, because "he has the ears." Obama stated that the two have discussed the possibility of a film based on the
2008 election, but this may not happen until the end of the Obama presidency.[]

Men in Black III opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major
starring role in four years. Reports indicate Smith would star in Men In Black 4.[24]

On August 19, 2011, it was announced[25] that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to
work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game. Smith's most
recent studio album, Lost and Found, was released in 2005.
Smith and his son Jaden played father and son in two productions: the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of
Happyness, and the science fiction film After Earth, which was released on May 31, 2013.
Smith is in talks to star and produce in the remake of the western film The Wild Bunch.
Smith is set to star in the upcoming con artist tale comedy Focus.

Smith credits his father's dedication to his own involvement in the lives of his
children.[26] Smith married Sheree Zampino in 1992. They had a son, Willard
Christopher Smith III, also known as Trey, but divorced in 1995. Trey appeared
in his father's music video for the 1998 single "Just the Two of Us".

Smith married actress Jada Pinkett in 1997. Together they have had two children:
Jaden Christopher Syre (born 1998), his co-star in The Pursuit of Happyness, and
Willow Camille Reign (born 2000), who appeared as his daughter in I Am

more than $500,000.[29]

Religious beliefs
Will Smith was raised in a Baptist household, and has stated that while he remains a Christian. he is "a student of all
religions, and I respect all people and all paths."[30] Though he is not a Scientologist and has denied rumors claiming
him as a member of the Church of Scientology, he has spoken favorably about it, saying "I just think a lot of the
ideas in Scientology are brilliant and revolutionary and non-religious."[31][32][33]

Smith gave $1.3 million to charities in 2007, of which $450,000 went to two Christian ministries, and $122,500 went
to three Scientology organizations; the remaining beneficiaries included "a Los Angeles mosque, other
Christian-based schools and churches, and [...] the Yitzhak Rabin Memorial Center in Israel."[] Smith and his wife
have also founded a private elementary school in Calabasas, California, the New Village Leadership Academy.[34]

Federal tax filing showed that Will Smith donated $1.2 million to the school in 2010.[35]

Political views
In 2012, he expressed support for the legalizing of same-sex marriage, in an endorsement of President Barack
Obama's declaration to adopt this stance on the issue.[36]
